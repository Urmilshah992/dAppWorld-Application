# GCD test

### Gavin, the CEO of a company, has hired you as an intern. To assess your proficiency in basic Solidity and mathematics, he has assigned you a task.

## Your task is to implement a smart contract that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two unsigned integers. Given two positive integers a and b, the GCD of a and b is defined as the greatest positive integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. Your solution must include a public function with the following signature:

### The smart contract must contain the following public funtion:

## function gcd(uint a, uint b) returns (uint): This function should take two unsigned integers as inputs and return the GCD of those two numbers as an unsigned integer output.
