## Storage Smart Contract

### This challenge will help you to learn how to save and retrieve values in smart contracts. Read and Write operations are the most important operations in any system, with this simple problem statement you will be able to understand how the read and write operations are done in smart contracts on the blockchain.

Your smart contract must contain the following public functions / constructor:

### Input:

storeValue(uint256 \_newValue) : This functions takes one argument of type unsigned integer which will be stored in the smart contract.

### Output:

readValue() returns (uint256): This function returns the stored value in the smart contract.
