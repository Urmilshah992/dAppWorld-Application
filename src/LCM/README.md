# LCM

## LCM (Least Common Multiple).

is the smallest multiple that two or more numbers have in common. In other words, it is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of the given numbers.

### Write a smartcontract which outputs the LCM of 2 numbers :

## function lcm(uint a, uint b) returns (uint):

This function should take two unsigned integers as inputs and return the LCM of those two numbers as an unsigned integer output.
