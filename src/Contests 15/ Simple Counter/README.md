# Simple Counter

### In a quaint town, a central bulletin board is the heart of community communication. However, there's no way to track the popularity of each announcement. To solve this, the town creates the "Community Counter" smart contract.

### Whenever a resident interacts with an announcement—be it checking event details or reading a notice—the counter increments. Weekly, the town council reviews the counts to gauge community interest. This simple solution empowers the town to better serve its residents and strengthen community bonds.

## Your smart contract must contain the following public functions / constructor:

## Input:

```
incrementCounter(uint announcement_id)  : This functions increments the counter for particular announcement ID. It is known that the ID is greater than 0.
```

## Output:

```
This function returns the number of counts someone interacted with an announcement for the respective announcement ID.
```
